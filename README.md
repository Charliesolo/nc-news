# Charlie Solomon's NC News

A deployed version of the site can be found here: 

https://ncnewscharlie.netlify.app/

This website is a news site that allows browsing all articles, browsing by topic, sorting articles, posting  comments and voting on comments and articles.

 The site was built to provide a front end to make use of the API I built which can be found here:
